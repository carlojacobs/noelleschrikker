# Noelle Schrikker's website
This is an online portfolio that I built for my mother.
## What I used
To build this website, I used basic `HTML`, `Javascript` and `CSS`. I also used a free css library called [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com), and a free bootstrap theme from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com).
